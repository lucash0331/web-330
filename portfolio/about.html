              I am an aspiring full-stack developer who is studying web development at Bellevue University. I served in the Marine Corps as a Machine gunner for four of the best years of my life. During that time, I learned how to be a great leader, great with time management, and outstanding attention to detail skills. Furthermore, I was born in the great state of Michigan where most of my family resides to this day.

              To name a few things I enjoy, I have a 4-year-old daughter that teaches me new games daily. I have learned to master playing dress up, barbies, and exploring local parks. Furthermore, I am a huge sports fan that watches anything Michigan related. In my free time, you can catch me working out, and taking my dog to the trails where we seem to get lost frequently. Also, I love to travel and I have been to over 15 different countries, with Israel being at the top of my list!
